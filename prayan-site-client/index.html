“PRAYAN FOUNDATION, a non-governmental organization registered under NITI AAYOG, was founded by a group of motivated undergraduate students led by Mr. Parth Ojha, who is recognized as the recipient of the President of India Award in field of Social Service. 
Our primary objective is to create the positive change we envision for the world. We strongly believe that a fulfilling life involves serving others, and we carry this belief with love, compassion, and kindness in our hearts every day. 
Prayan Foundation is committed to realizing the goals of India@75, guided by the esteemed Prime Minister of India. Initially, we launched three central projects—Project Akshaypatra, Project Swashrit, and Project Prakrit—that garnered participation from students across Delhi University. 
Subsequently, we decentralized our efforts by establishing individual umbrella units in colleges to extend our support to more individuals in need. Our organization has a strong presence in Delhi University, with units in more than 14 prominent colleges. In addition to that, we also have units in 5+ campus across the nation extending & serving our sense of selfless service.
With a functional strength of 500+ members, we have a dedicated team of individuals working towards our goals. Alongside our members, we also have a large network of volunteers, with more than 2000 individuals actively contributing to our cause. Together, we strive to make a positive impact in our communities and society.

                                   The Akshaypatra project is one of the main initiatives of the Prayan Foundation, that aims to promote food security and sustainability. Akshaypatra, which means "inexhaustible vessel," embodies the idea of abundance and generosity in Indian culture. The project works towards fulfilling the mission of "Annadanam Param Daanam," which means "The Gift of Food is great to cater." Akshaypatra is a team of about 20 enthusiastic peolpe along with core members of Prayan Foundation. We collect food from PGs and other sources and distributes it to those who need it most in areas around North Campus like Malka Ganj, Kamla Nagar, Vijay Nagar, near GTB metro station and Vishwavidyalaya metro station, New Delhi. We are targeting the scattered population along road sides in these areas who can't even afford two meals a day. Since January 2023, the foundation has conducted eight successful drives, feeding around 30-40 people each time. We are working towards conducting four food distribution drives each month, as well as increasing our efforts to ensure food security and sustainability.This includes creating awareness about the importance of food security and implementing sustainable practices in food distribution. By providing food to those in need and promoting food security and sustainability, Project Akshaypatra is making a significant difference in the lives of many. It relies on the support of individuals and organizations to continue its work and achieve its goals. Together, we can work towards creating a better, more sustainable future for all.

It's been a month since we started working on this project. we have about 14 to 16 members with us with core members as well.
 Having a great team helps to come up with better ideas and the work becomes easy and much more effective. Gender equality is a basic human right, and it is also fundamental to have a peaceful, prosperous world. 
But girls and women continue to face significant challenges all around the world. Women are typically underrepresented in power and decision-making roles. the unit has recently started spreading awareness about mensturation as it is very normal thing which is necessary for every woman. Menstruation, or period, is normal vaginal bleeding that occurs as part of a woman’s monthly cycle. Every month, your body prepares for pregnancy. If no pregnancy occurs, the uterus, or womb, sheds its lining. The menstrual blood is partly blood and partly tissue from inside the uterus

                                   Svakarman" is the initiative by students of Daulat Ram College. "svakarman" is a Sanskrit term which means self employment, we aim to empower individuals and community by providing them with the resources knowledge and the support that they need and run successful businesses day by contributing to local economic growth and development .

It involves exploring skills of people living in slums and  monetizing it so that these people can earn a good profit .Every skill has a market and some kind of demand, some are more in demand and some in less but that does not change the fact that there is a demand for almost every skill that exists i.e. sewing, painting, embroidering, cooking, art & craft, etc. The list is endless and so are the opportunities. We are a team of 29 zealous members consisting of a joint secretary ,head and volunteers and we believe that true charity is not giving bread or money but by providing employment.

                                    Samatva  is the Hindu concept of equanimity. Its root is sama (सम) meaning – equal or even. Sāmya - meaning equal consideration towards all human beings - is a variant of the word.
“All enjoyment is dependent on certain conditions being met, much enjoyment occurs because some accomplish goals, this may be highly relative and dependent. Expectations of any benefit, that can be of any material gain, according to Bhagavad Gita is removed from ourselves. Knowledge of ourselves is in balance, the fruits of actions are changeable, unnecessary, unreal, unimportant, they lack what can uplift, they aren't furthering dignity, love and happiness and are transitory physically, mostly unrelated to knowledge and the true self.”

                                    The initiative is named Karuna keeping in mind the objective of SGTB Khalsa College. 
Karuna is a Sanskrit term which means compassion. We at Karuna Extend that empathy, compassion and kindness to all other animals, including animals raised and killed for food, clothing, or other such uses.
 Karuna works with the aim of Jeevarakshanam samvardhan which means "fostering and rearing animals for their survival". Our motto is to provide a protected environment for animals.
At our Khalsa unit, we aim to give a protected environment to the animals. Our initiative "Karuna" is an illustration of that. At Karuna, we aspire to create a small protected world for these to co-exist happily. This idea focuses on promoting a holistic approach to animal welfare, which encompasses not only the physical health and safety of animals, but also their emotional well-being, socialization, and mental enrichment. Our team of dedicated members ensures that animals get compassionate care and love. We strive to create a community that values the presence of these innocent beings.
